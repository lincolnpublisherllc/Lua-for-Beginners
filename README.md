Lua for Beginners — Extracted Code Archive

This archive contains all runnable Lua code examples extracted chapter by chapter from the book “Lua for Beginners”.
Non-runnable material such as “Expected output,” “Example session,” and console transcripts has been excluded to keep the collection focused.

Structure

Chapter folders: Each chapter has its own folder, named Chapter_XX.

Filenames:

If the book specified a filename in a comment (e.g., -- hello.lua or -- save as myscript.lua), that name is used.

If no filename was provided, the file is named snippet_XX.lua in sequential order within the chapter.

Manifest:

manifest.csv — Tabular view of all scripts with chapter, title, filename, and line counts.

manifest.json — Same data in JSON format for programmatic use.

How to Use

Navigate by chapter
Browse into the folder for the chapter you’re studying to find relevant examples.

Run a script
From a terminal with Lua installed:

lua filename.lua


Replace filename.lua with the actual script name (e.g., hello.lua).

Learn progressively
Many examples build on earlier ones. Start from Chapter 01 and move forward to see how features accumulate.

Notes

Only the Lua source code is included here — not the book text.

Code has been preserved exactly as written in the book, with minor cleanup (like trimming trailing blanks).

Some snippets are small demonstrations rather than full programs. They are still useful as learning references.
